# The Demon and the Blasphemer

A personal project, driven by the desire to create a unique gameboy experience and to tackle its limitations head on.<br>
This project is created with the dev build version 1.2 of [GB Studio](https://www.gbstudio.dev/).<br>
Additional software being used are: 
- [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) for all graphical assets
- [fmmidi](http://unhaut.x10host.com/fmmidi/) in order to understand the inner workings of .midi files.
- [OpenMPT](https://openmpt.org/) for the transcription of .midi files into .mod files for the gbt player.

I am also happy to give my thanks to the very helpful [Discord Community Server](https://discord.gg/bxerKnc) of GB Studio.
